  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a graphic designer from Norway looking to widen my skills in <strong>front end development</strong>. I studied visual communication in Australia and have worked as a finished artist and digital designer there. I would like to learn to code as I'm starting to look for work back home again.</p><br>
  <p>I think the most important thing for me is to <strong>keep learning</strong>, closely followed with finish what you've started and doing it right.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I'm from Stavanger, a biggish town in between the fjords and the beaches on the west coast of Norway. I love the closeness of nature and the long hours of daylight during summer.</p>
